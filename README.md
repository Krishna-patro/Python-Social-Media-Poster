# Python Social Media Poster (Conceptual)

This project contains conceptual code for automating social media posts on Instagram, X, and Facebook. It serves as a guide to understand the general process of using developer APIs to post content. **Crucially, it emphasizes the need to register as a developer on each platform and obtain the necessary API keys and access tokens.**

## Features
- Provides a template for interacting with different social media APIs.
- Uses the `requests` library for sending HTTP requests.

## Requirements
- A developer account on Instagram, X, or Facebook.
- API keys, secrets, and access tokens for each platform.

## Usage
1. Review the conceptual code in `post_social_media.py`.
2. Follow the official documentation for each platform to get your credentials.
3. Replace the placeholder variables with your actual credentials.
4. Run the script from your terminal.
